# Notes

* The power LED (+ resistor) and the bypass capacitor are optional.
* The value of R1 might be too high to get enough current for the LED and can
  be replaced with a lower value if necessary. The value is set quite high to
  minimize power usage and still works fine with the components I use.
* All parts in the BOM can be replaced with pretty much any similar parts.
